Simple project written in Python to replicate the most common parts of dd.
Inspired by: https://code.activestate.com/recipes/578907-python-awesome-dd/

Mostly for educational purposes - a means for me to learn about reading
from and writing to block devices at various locations, and to help
others learn.

The intent is to not have it use any external python libraries, and
remain relatively simple.
